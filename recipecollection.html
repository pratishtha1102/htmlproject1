        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>To make this delicious chocolate cake, start by preheating your oven to 175°C (350°F) and greasing and flouring two 9-inch round cake pans.<br>

            In a large mixing bowl, combine 250g of all-purpose flour, 50g of cocoa powder, 150g of fine sugar, 5g of baking powder,<br> 5g of baking soda, and 1 teaspoon of salt. In a separate bowl, beat 2 large eggs, and then add 240ml (1 cup) of whole milk, 120ml (1/2 cup) of vegetable oil, and 2 teaspoons of pure vanilla extract.<br> Mix the wet ingredients well.
            
            Combine the wet and dry ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be cautious not to overmix. Gradually add 240ml (1 cup) of water to the batter, stirring until smooth. <br>The batter may appear thin, but that's normal.
            
            Pour the batter evenly into the prepared cake pans and bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. <br>Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.
            
            Once the cakes are cooled, you can frost and decorate them according to your preference. <br>Whether it's a rich chocolate ganache, creamy buttercream, or any other favorite frosting, this chocolate cake is ready to be enjoyed!</p>
