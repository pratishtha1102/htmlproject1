        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p> <ol><li>Preheat your oven to 175°C (350°F) and grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li><br>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine:
            <ul>
                <li>250g all-purpose flour</li>
                
                <li>50g cocoa powder</li>
                <li>150g fine sugar</li>
                <li>5g baking powder</li>
                <li>5g baking soda</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            </ul>
        </li><br>
        <li>In a separate bowl, beat 2 large eggs, and then add:
            <ul>
                <li>240ml (1 cup) whole milk</li>
                <li>120ml (1/2 cup) vegetable oil</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
                <li>Mix the wet ingredients well.</li>
            </ul>
        </li><br>
        <li>Combine the wet and dry ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be cautious not to overmix.</li><Br>
        <li>Gradually add 240ml (1 cup) of water to the batter, stirring until smooth. The batter may appear thin, but that's normal.</li><br>
        <li>Pour the batter evenly into the prepared cake pans and bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick <br>inserted into the center comes out clean.</li><br>
        <li>Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Once the cakes are cooled, you can frost and decorate them according to your preference. Whether it's a rich chocolate ganache, <br>creamy buttercream, or any other favorite frosting, this chocolate cake is ready to be enjoyed!</li>
